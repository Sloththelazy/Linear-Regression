What You'll Find Here:
Notes & Tutorials: My personal notes and summaries on various TensorFlow topics, including:
Core concepts (`tensors`, `variables`, `graphs`, etc.)
`Neural network architectures (DNNs, CNNs, RNNs)`
`Training techniques (optimization, regularization)`
Model deployment and serving
Projects: Code implementations of `TensorFlow projects`, ranging from simple examples to more complex applications.
Resources: Links to helpful articles, tutorials, and documentation that I've found useful in my learning process.
Why I Created This Repository:
Personal Reference: A central place to organize my TensorFlow knowledge and easily find what I need.
Skill Sharpening: A space to practice and experiment with TensorFlow, solidifying my understanding.
Community Sharing: An opportunity to share my learning journey and potentially help others who are also learning TensorFlow.
How to Use This Repository:
Feel free to explore the notes, code, and resources. If you find something useful, great! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

Let's Learn Together!
I'm always looking to improve my TensorFlow skills and knowledge. If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to connect and learn together. Feel free to reach out!
