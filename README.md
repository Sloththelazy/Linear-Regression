# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a linear regression model implemented in [programming language of your choice - Python, R, etc.]. The project focuses on [briefly describe the problem you're solving or the goal of the project].

## Project Overview

* **Model:** Linear regression is used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
* **Data:** The dataset used for this project is [describe your dataset briefly - source, size, features].
* **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using [list the evaluation metrics you used - MSE, MAE, R-squared].
